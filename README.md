A tiny static blog generator written in go.

This isn't quite ready yet. I'm still planning to add some pretty crucial features,
clean up the code, and make it a little simpler to use. I will update this README
with more details after I make those changes.

In the meantime, if you're looking for a static blog generator written in go, check out
